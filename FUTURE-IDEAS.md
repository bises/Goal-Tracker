This document tracks potential improvements and features to consider for future development.

## UX/UI Improvements

### Planner Page - Task Display Options

**Context**: Currently using a drawer/bottom sheet to show tasks for a selected date.

**Alternative Approach**: Display tasks inline below the calendar instead of in a drawer

- **Pros**:
  - Everything visible on one screen
  - No modal/overlay needed
  - More desktop-friendly
  - Saves vertical space by keeping content in flow
- **Cons**:
  - Takes up space in the main view
  - May push content below the fold on mobile
  - Less focused interaction (no modal isolation)

**Decision**: Keep drawer for now. Revisit when we have more user feedback.
